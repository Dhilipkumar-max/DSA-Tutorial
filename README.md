# 🚀 Mastery of DSA in 50 Days

Welcome to **Mastery of DSA in 50 Days** 🎯  
This repository is **not just for me** — it’s a **shared learning journey** for anyone who wants to improve **Data Structures & Algorithms step by step**.

👉 You can **study along with me**, practice daily, and grow together.

---

## 📌 What Is This Challenge?

This is a **50-day structured DSA challenge** designed to:

- Build **strong problem-solving logic**
- Understand **DSA fundamentals clearly**
- Learn **multiple approaches** for the same problem
- Analyze **time & space complexity**
- Prepare for **coding interviews**

We start from **basic logic building** and gradually move to **advanced DSA topics**.

---

## 🧠 How This Repository Helps You Study

For **every problem**, you will find:

- ✅ Problem statement
- ✅ **Naive approach** (basic / beginner logic)
- ✅ **Alternative approach**
- ✅ **Optimized / expected solution**
- ✅ **Time Complexity**
- ✅ **Space Complexity**
- ✅ Clean, readable, well-commented code

📌 This helps you **compare solutions and understand optimization deeply**.
